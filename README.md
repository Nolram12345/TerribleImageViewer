# TerribleImageViewer
An tiny image viewer, hastely hacked together out of ImGui and DX11 for viewing images on Windows.
I just needed this because there is no built-in way of viewing TGAs and HDRs on windows.

Don't look at the code, if you need a quick image viewer just download a binary build or something.
